floorWeights: wall dead load should be included, assume only consider peripheral 
wall dead load calculation : (60ft (x dimension) + 30ft (z dimension))*2*9.25ft (floor height)*16psf(Table 2.3 SEAOSC) = 26.64kips

roof will take half-height of peripheral wall self weight 
typical floor will take full-height of peripheral wall self weight
